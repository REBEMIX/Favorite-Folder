        <p> Coding is one of my favorite hobbies because I nearly started coding a year ago. I thought it was going to be basic, not even app making, just simply making a sprite move up and down. But then later on I realized there was much more to it, like making apps on different websites and eventually making websites! Coding was a new experience that I overcomed and studied to have a good education for an interesting mind-set. Along with that, I had an amazing teacher to guide me! Coding has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to understand it!
