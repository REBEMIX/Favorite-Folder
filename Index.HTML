        <p> Reeyan Thakrar is a young coder who was always interested in coding. The fascination of making games, apps, websites, etc. When he tried it out it was easy at first, but as he progressed it became harder and harder. Now from app-making to website-making, he's had his fair share of interesting challenges. But that is entertainment to him when doing a challenge and being the only one who rises. Coding has been a fun experience and he canâ€™t wait as to what comes ahead.
